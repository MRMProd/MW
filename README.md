MW for using with autoISF 3.6.6
You enable the different "modes" with a TT set to that BG target (or a profile bg target enabling another mode at night etc)
This middleware disbales bgAccel during night time, this can be done using a different bg target at night and can be set to disable bgAccel or change other settings at night.
